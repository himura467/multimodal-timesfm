# WandB Sweep Configuration for Baseline (Fine-tuned) TimesFM Hyperparameter Tuning
# This configuration uses Climate as validation, Energy as test, and all others as training
# Optimizes based on test MSE on Energy dataset

# Sweep method: random, grid, or bayes
method: bayes

# Metric to optimize (test MSE on Energy dataset)
metric:
  name: test_mse
  goal: minimize
