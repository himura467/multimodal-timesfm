# WandB Sweep Configuration for Testing Bias Hypothesis in Fusion Layer
# This configuration tests whether bias in the fully connected projection layer is necessary
# Uses Climate as validation, Energy as test, and all others as training

# Sweep method: grid search to test all combinations
method: grid

# Metric to optimize (test MSE on Energy dataset)
metric:
  name: test_mse
  goal: minimize

# Hyperparameter search space
parameters:
  # Main parameter: test with and without bias
  use_bias:
    values: [true, false]

  # Fixed hyperparameters (use reasonable defaults from previous tuning)
  learning_rate:
    value: 1e-3

  weight_decay:
    value: 0.05

  batch_size:
    value: 4

  gradient_accumulation_steps:
    value: 2

  num_epochs:
    value: 10
